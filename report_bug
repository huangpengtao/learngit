1 get_dhcp_agents_hosting_networks
 if network_ids

 query.filter(NetworkDhcpAgentBinding.network_id == network_ids[0])
 and query.filter(NetworkDhcpAgentBinding.network_id in network_ids)
 are equivalent when len(network_ids) ==1, this change uses such 
 property to simplify get_dhcp_agents_hosting_networks implementation.
